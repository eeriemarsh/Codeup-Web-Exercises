            “All right," said Susan. "I'm not stupid. You're saying humans need...<br>
            fantasies to make life bearable."<br>

            REALLY? AS IF IT WAS SOME KIND OF PINK PILL? NO. HUMANS NEED<br>
            FANTASY TO BE HUMAN. TO BE THE PLACE WHERE THE FALLING<br>
            ANGEL MEETS THE RISING APE.<br>

            "Tooth fairies? Hogfathers? Little—"<br>

            YES. AS PRACTICE. YOU HAVE TO START OUT LEARNING TO BELIEVE<br>
            THE LITTLE LIES.<br>

            "So we can believe the big ones?"<br>

            YES. JUSTICE. MERCY. DUTY. THAT SORT OF THING.<br>

            "They're not the same at all!"<br>

            YOU THINK SO? THEN TAKE THE UNIVERSE AND GRIND IT DOWN TO<br>
            THE FINEST POWDER AND SIEVE IT THROUGH THE FINEST SIEVE AND<br>
            THEN SHOW ME ONE ATOM OF JUSTICE, ONE MOLECULE OF MERCY.<br>
            AND YET—Death waved a hand. AND YET YOU ACT AS IF THERE IS<br>
            SOME IDEAL ORDER IN THE WORLD, AS IF THERE IS SOME...SOME<br>
            RIGHTNESS IN THE UNIVERSE BY WHICH IT MAY BE JUDGED.<br>

            "Yes, but people have got to believe that, or what's the point—"<br>

            MY POINT EXACTLY.<br>

            ― Terry Pratchett, Hogfather<br>
